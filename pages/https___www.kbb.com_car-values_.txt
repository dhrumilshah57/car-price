You might find the same new car at a lot of different dealerships - but how do know what you should pay?

Good thing KBB.com has done the analysis for you. What should I pay for a used car? Maybe more than any other type of car value, used car prices can be confusing for a buyer. You have to think about the options, the condition, the mileage and where you can find that actual vehicle for sale. Then you usually have to negotiate the price. Not to worry. KBB.com has the knowledge and expertise to give you the information to buy with confidence. As a reference, we provide a Typical Listing Price that's based on the asking prices you might see at the dealership. Even more important are the Used Car Fair Market Range and Used Car Fair Purchase Price. Drawing from thousands of actual sales and powered by 90 years of industry know-how, the Kelley Blue Book® Used Car Fair Market Range and Fair Purchase Price will help you evaluate if you're getting a good deal or not.

The Private Party Value is usually more than the Trade-in Value, because if you sell it yourself, you’re the one spending the money, time and effort. Trading in at the dealer is convenient, but you get a little less. Are Kelley Blue Book® Values accurate? The question “What’s the Blue Book Value?” has been part of buying and selling a car for over 90 years. And simply put, no one has more experience with vehicle values and pricing than Kelley Blue Book. We’ve been the go-to source for both consumers and the automotive industry since 1926. We leverage massive amounts of data, including actual transactions - then adjust for local market conditions and seasonal trends.
