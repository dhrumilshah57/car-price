It also comes with a lot of benefits, as listed here: Lower running costs High fuel prices and an extensive list of components makes a combustion engine model more expensive to run compared to an EV which is easier to maintain and electricity is cheaper. Performance and driving experience An electric motor has the benefit of immediate performance and no gears, offering a responsive and convenient driving experience in all sizes. Technology All EVs are inherently better suited to offer more technology than existing combustion engine models. This applies to features around safety, infotainment, comfort and a connected experience. Eco-friendly While some may argue the ‘zero emission’ tag applied to EVs, they are undeniably cleaner than combustion engines when it comes to tailpipe emissions and therefore more eco-friendly. Convenient charging The fact that you can simply plug your EV in at your home or office and have it recharged for the day is definitely more convenient than having to drive to a fuel station every time. Tax benefits In order to promote EV adoption, various levels of government are offering tax benefits to lower the cost of purchase and ownership compared to a similar combustion engine car. The hydrogen potential EVs will not be limited to external charging as we know of. Fuel cell vehicles powered by hydrogen, another clean fuel with water as its only tailpipe emission, is projected to be the future source of power for EVs. India’s 2030 EV targets The Indian government intends to have EVs account for 30% of private cars by 2030 at an estimated tally of 8 crore cars, with an influx of new affordable EVs expected from 2025.

Control Level of Charge Having the battery percentage dip close to zero, or charging it to 100 per cent, are both bad for an EV. These extremes can reduce the battery’s capacity to store electricity and even drain faster over time. Avoid Exposure to Hot Temperatures Do not leave your EV parked under the hot sun for long durations. Doing so can expose your electric vehicle to extreme hot temperatures and can potentially damage the battery. Check Battery Coolant To ensure that the battery is always working within the preset safe operating temperature, it is necessary to check the battery coolant level at regular intervals. Parking for Longer Periods When parked for an extended period of time (more than a month), maintain a charging range of 40 to 60% to safeguard the battery's health.

Here is what some of our customers have to say. Pros Zero emissions As EVs don’t feature an internal combustion engine, they have zero tail-pipe emissions, making them a little more environment-friendly. Low running costs Compared to fuel prices, electricity is more affordable, reducing the daily running costs of an electric vehicle. Cheaper to maintain Fewer mechanical components leads to reduced expenses during services, thereby bringing down the overall costs of maintenance. High on performance Having an electric powertrain, the instantaneous acceleration makes them easy and fun to drive to cater to the enthusiast in you. Cons Lack of EV infrastructure Undertaking unplanned long trips can cause range anxiety thanks to the lack of proper charging infrastructure. High battery costs Replacing a lithium-ion battery, which is available with most electric cars, usually tends to be an expensive affair. Long charge times An EV, even with fast charging, takes a lot longer to juice up the battery than it would take to refuel your car. Higher purchase costs EVs tend to be more expensive than their ICE counterparts, majorly because of the price of their battery pack(s).

Frequently Asked Questions On Electric Cars What is an electric car? An electric car is a motor vehicle which is powered by electricity rather than combustible fuels like petrol or diesel, or even CNG. Instead of an internal combustion engine (ICE), electric cars use a refillable battery and electric motor setup for propulsion. How do electric cars work? All electric cars use a battery pack which stores electrical energy and powers one or more electric motors. This electric motor transmits the mechanical energy to the transmission which then rotates the wheels. An electric car’s battery needs to be recharged by plugging it into a charging station, or any compatible source of electricity. Do electric cars have gears? Electric cars don’t have gears in the conventional sense as offered in internal combustion engine (ICE) cars with manual transmissions. However, the majority of EVs use a single-gear (single-speed) automatic transmission. Do electric cars have transmissions? Yes, all electric cars have a single-speed automatic transmission. However, this is not the same as a transmission in a combustion-engined car, which usually has gears. How to charge an electric car? There are many ways to charge an electric car. You can charge your electric car at home using a 15A socket or wallbox AC charger. Your electric car can also be charged from most charging stations, and also at a faster speed using a DC fast charger that can be found at a charging station. When was the first electric car invented? The first electric car that was practical and driven was invented in 1884 by Thomas Parker in England. However, the first-ever person-carrying electric vehicle was invented a bit earlier in 1881 by Gustave Trouvé, who fitted an electric motor in a tricycle. Also, small-scale uses of electric propulsion systems had begun as early as the 1830s. How to open an electric car charging station in India? To open a charging station in India, the basic requirements include availability of land, investment and compatible electrical infrastructure. Also, as per the Indian government, you don’t need a license to open an electric car charging station as long as you meet the standards set by the Ministry of Power. Various independent manufacturers of EV chargers are open to partner with individuals interested in setting up a compliant charging station. What is the future of electric vehicles? With the battery technology and charging infrastructure evolving and growing over the years, electric vehicles or EVs will also start becoming more affordable and accessible. This will, in turn, help reduce the overall air pollution and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. View More Home New Cars Electric Cars × We need your city to customize your experience
