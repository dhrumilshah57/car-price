Whether you’re interested in new car prices, certified used car prices (aka Certified Pre-Owned or CPO) or used car prices, we use over 90 years of knowledge to tell you what you should expect to pay for your next car. We call it the Kelley Blue Book® Price Advisor. It shows you the Kelley Blue Book® Fair Purchase Price, Kelley Blue Book® Fair Market Range and other pricing details to give you a real look at what a car should cost in your area. To help you with a fair car price, we update or validate our data weekly to provide market-reflective prices, relied upon by both consumers and the automotive industry. Car Pricing Questions What is the Kelley Blue Book Price Advisor? The Kelley Blue Book® Price Advisor is a range-based pricing tool to help car buyers and sellers talk about price realistically. Research from a recent Cox Automotive Car Buying Journey Study showed that shoppers are looking for a fair car price not only for new vehicles, but also for used vehicles and the vehicles they currently own. Focusing on a single price doesn't consider all the variables associated with structuring a car deal. The Kelley Blue Book® Price Advisor is designed to reduce friction between buyers and sellers. How are car prices determined? Kelley Blue Book has its own special formula, perfected over 90+ years of experience with car prices. Today, we look at hundreds of thousands of vehicle transactions each week and factor in items like supply & demand and seasonality. And because car prices aren’t the same across the country, we have car pricing based on over 120 geographic regions in the US and analyze each region individually to reflect local pricing and economic conditions. We even tell you if the asking price that the dealer provides to us is a "Great Price" or a "Good Price" so you can feel more confident when you make your deal. How to get the best price on a new or used car? If you have a trade-in, learn the value of your current car. Determine a monthly payment and a term that works for you. Get pre-qualified for a car loan from your bank or credit union. Sometimes dealers can beat the rate you find; sometimes not. Know the Fair Market Range to be sure you don’t overpay. If it’s a new car, negotiate with a few dealerships online for the best price. For more, see "10 Insider Tips for Car Buying" Are Kelley Blue Book® Values accurate? The question “What’s the Blue Book Value?” has been part of buying and selling a car for over 90 years. And simply put, no one has more experience with vehicle values and pricing than Kelley Blue Book. We’ve been the go-to source for both consumers and the automotive industry since 1926. We leverage massive amounts of data, including actual transactions - then adjust for local market conditions and seasonal trends. Our values reflect both wholesale and retail transactions to provide a 360 degree view of the market. We update our pricing at least weekly to reflect the market and give dealers and consumers the most up-to-date pricing.
