Price quotes can save you time. They’re quick to get, and you don’t have to spend your free time driving from dealer to dealer. Price quotes can save you money. You can ask up to 3 dealers for their best new car price up front and even start your deal from home. Price quotes put you in control. You choose the dealers. You make the call who you work with. Price quotes are free. So what do you have to lose? Read More Will dealers contact me when I ask for a price quote? Except in rare occasions, yes. But remember – only the dealers you choose can contact you. They know you’re a serious buyer or are at least seriously interested in finding a good deal. Depending on the dealer, they may email you, call or text. Many dealerships have an internet sales team specifically to handle price quote requests. Read More Am I obligated to use the price quote? No. There’s no obligation when you get a quote. You can get a price quote before you’re ready to buy - just to test the waters. Once you’ve made up your mind, you can ask for a price quote to finalize negotiations or to challenge another dealer’s “best price.” It’s always free, and you’re never obligated. Read More About the Find a Trade-in Car Dealer Program After you get your Kelley Blue Book® Trade-In Value, you can now start the trade-in process right away. Since most people who trade in a car buy another new car, Certified Pre-Owned car or used car, you can save time and probably get a good deal by finding the same dealer to trade in your car and shop for another car. Choose up to three car dealers near you. Once they contact you, ask them for the best price for your trade in and then get a free no-obligation quote for the car you’re interested in next. See where you stand before you visit the dealership and even start to negotiate from home. It’s that easy!
